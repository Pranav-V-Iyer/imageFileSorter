# Thanks to f8-rp for his contributions to this project

# Directions:
# You will need to pip install the tkinter package
# Replace the string 'imageFolder' with the directory of the folder with your original images
# Replace the strings 'folder_1' and 'folder_2' with the directories of the folders you want to sort your images into
# If you want to add more folders, add another folder_path variable and elif, following the same format
